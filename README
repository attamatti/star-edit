A user friendly utility to edit relion star files.
Run with:
star-edit.py <input file> <output file>
run with the tag --headless to output only the data with out the starfile header - useful for merging two starfiles together.

star-edit.py has three major functions:

1) Arithmetic: perform an arithmetic function on each value in the column.  Useful for binning/unbinning, but other functions are available too if you want to get creative.
2) Text subsitution: Substitute one bit of text for another in every value in the column
3) Delete column.
